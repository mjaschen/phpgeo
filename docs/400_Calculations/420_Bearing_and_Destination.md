# Bearing and Destination

[TOC]

phpgeo can be used to calculate the bearing between two points and to
get a destination point for a given start point together with a bearing
angle and a distance.

Multiple calculation algorithms are supported. Currently, phpgeo provides
methods for calculations with a _spherical_ earth model and with an
_ellipsoidal_ model. The spherical calculations are very fast, compared
to the ellipsoidal methods. The ellipsoidal algorithms are a bit more
precise on the other hand.

## Bearing between two points

Given two points, it's possible to calculate the bearing angled between
those points.

phpgeo can calculate the initial bearing (bearing as seen from the first
point) and the final bearing (bearing as seen approaching the destination
point).

### Calculation with a spherical earth model

``` php
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingSpherical;
use Location\Coordinate;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);
$london = new Coordinate(51.5, -0.12);

$bearingCalculator = new BearingSpherical();

$startTime = microtime(true);
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateBearing($berlin, $london));
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateFinalBearing($berlin, $london));
$endTime = microtime(true);
printf("Time elapsed: %0.6f s\n", ($endTime - $startTime));
```

The code above will produce the following output:

``` plaintext
double(268.60722336693)
double(257.85494586285)
Time elapsed: 0.000285 s
```

### Calculation with an ellipsoidal earth model

``` php
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);
$london = new Coordinate(51.5, -0.12);

$bearingCalculator = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$startTime = microtime(true);
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateBearing($berlin, $london));
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateFinalBearing($berlin, $london));
$endTime = microtime(true);
printf("Time elapsed: %0.6f s\n", ($endTime - $startTime));
```

The code above will produce the following output:

``` plaintext
double(268.62436347111)
double(257.87203657292)
Time elapsed: 0.000304 s
```

Both calculations finish in roughly the same time. One would expect the
second calculation to be clearly slower than the first one. It seems
the exit condition for the iteration is reached quite fast. There might
exist other conditions where the ellipsoidal calculation is noticeable
slower.

## Destination point for given bearing and distance

As an example, starting from Berlin, calculate the destination point in
56.1 km distance with an initial bearing of 153 degrees:

``` php
<?php
use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Bearing\BearingSpherical;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);

$bearingSpherical = new BearingSpherical();
$bearingEllipsoidal = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$destination1 = $BearingSpherical->calculateDestination($berlin, 153, 56100);
$destination2 = $bearingEllipsoidal->calculateDestination($berlin, 153, 56100);

echo "Spherical:   " . $destination1->format(new DecimalDegrees()) . PHP_EOL;
echo "Ellipsoidal: " . $destination2->format(new DecimalDegrees()) . PHP_EOL;
```

The code above will produce the output below:

``` plaintext
Spherical:   52.04988 13.87628
Ellipsoidal: 52.05020 13.87126
```

Oh, look, what a [beautiful spot on earth](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.0499&mlon=13.8762#map=13/52.0499/13.8762) it is. ;-)

## Final Bearing for a calculated destination

*phpgeo* can calculate the final bearing angle for a given starting point,
an initial bearing, and the distance to the destination.

``` php
<?php
use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);

$bearingEllipsoidal = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$finalBearing = $bearingEllipsoidal->calculateDestinationFinalBearing($berlin, 153, 56100);

var_dump($finalBearing);
```

The code above will produce the output below:

``` plaintext
float(153.29365182147)
```
