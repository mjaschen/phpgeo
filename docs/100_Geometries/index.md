# Geometries

_phpgeo_ provides several geometry classes:

* [`Coordinate`](Coordinate)
* [`Line`](Line)
* [`Polyline`](Polyline)
* [`Polygon`](Polygon)

A Coordinate represents a geographic location, i.e. it contains a latitude
and a longitude - together with a so-called Ellipsoid.

A Line consists of two coordinates, while polylines and polygons are built
from two or more coordinates.
