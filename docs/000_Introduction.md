# What is *phpgeo?*

*phpgeo* is a small PHP library which provides abstractions to geographical
coordinates (including support for different ellipsoids), polylines
("GPS Tracks"), polygons, bounds, and more. *phpgeo* allows you to perform
different calculations with these abstractions, as distances, track
lengths, etc.

*phpgeo* is developed by [Marcus Jaschen](https://www.marcusjaschen.de/) and all
[contributors](https://github.com/mjaschen/phpgeo/graphs/contributors).
